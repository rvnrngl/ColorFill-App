# Color Fill - Android App

This is a thesis project that I developed to simulate various types of colorblindness and provide tests to help identify color vision deficiencies.

## Features

### Colorblindness Simulation
The app can simulate the following types of colorblindness:
- **Deuteranomaly**: A reduced sensitivity to green light
- **Protanomaly**: A reduced sensitivity to red light
- **Tritanomaly**: A reduced sensitivity to blue light
- **Deuteranopia**: Complete inability to perceive green light
- **Protanopia**: Complete inability to perceive red light
- **Tritanopia**: Complete inability to perceive blue light
- **Monochromacy**: Complete color blindness

### Tests
The app includes the following tests:
- **Ishihara Test**: A test using a series of colored dot patterns to detect colorblindness.
- **Tap the Color**: A test where users choose the one different shade of color among four options.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rvnrngl/ColorFill.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Select the type of colorblindness you want to simulate.
3. Navigate to the tests section to take the Ishihara test or the "Tap the Color" test.
